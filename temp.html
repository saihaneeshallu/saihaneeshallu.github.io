          <p>I'm currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Science at <a href="https://utdallas.edu">The University of
              Texas at Dallas</a>, where I'm part of the <a href= 'https://labs.utdallas.edu/irvl/'>Intelligent
                Robotics and Vision Lab</a>, under the guidance of Dr. Yu Xiang. My primary focus is at the intersection of
            robotics and computer vision, specifically applied to navigation, exploration, and mobile manipulation.</p>

          <p>My journey in advanced technology began with a Bachelor’s degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering
            from the National Institute of Technology, Warangal. I then pursued a Master’s in Control Systems at the
            Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. During my master's program, I co-founded VECROS Technologies, where I
            served as the Chief Technology Officer. In this role, I led the development of GPS-denied navigation for
            multi-rotor aircraft systems and IoT-based BVLOS (Beyond Visual Line of Sight) operations.</p>

          <p>Now, as a Ph.D. candidate, I am eager to push the boundaries of what’s possible in robotics and contribute
            to developing technologies that assist humans in their daily lives.</p>
